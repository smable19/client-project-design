          <p class="description">I come from a background of marketing and communications with 4+ years of experience across multiple industries. My area of expertise is in process and procedural development, brand design, goal-setting/tracking performance metrics over time, engaging audeinces across multiple channels, and developing guidelines for copywriting, messaging, and visual identity. Naturally, this was a segue into web development, and now I freelance design websites and apps for various clients. I'm a graduate from the Environmental Studies BA program at The University of Colorado Boulder. In Colorado, I was a local community organizer with experience in radio, environmental justice, reproductive rights, and nonprofit work.
